# LSDS
Large-Scale Distributed Systems projects
=========================================

This repository contains the three projects done for the LSDS class taught in the University of Neuch√¢tel, in the Fall semester of 2015. Every project was coded in Lua. (Also, note that I did not "clean" the folders, so they are a bit messy)

Project 1: Peer Sampling Service (PSS)
--------------------------------------
The objective was to implement the PSS using gossip-based dissemination.

Project 2: Distributed Hash Tables (DHT)
----------------------------------------
The objective was to implement a key-routing layer, and add a DHT on top of this layer.

Project 3: Fireflies-inspired synchronization
---------------------------------------------
The objective was to inspire from fireflies to synchronize computers in a decentralized way.
